Python GUI programming
==========================================

### [Motivation]
- I have been using Robinhood for my stock trade. Robinhood is a good application but I found out that it is not easy to see my real-time gain & loss and transaction history in Robinhood. Thus, I would like to build a small app for it as my first experience using PyQt5

### [Requirement]
- Python 3.6+, PyQt5, sqlite3, iexfinance
